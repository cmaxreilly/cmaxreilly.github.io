        <p>
            Hello, and thank you for coming to my website. I just started learning HTML, and I will start a course on CSS very soon. I love coding, and I am getting better with time. With this website, I plan to show you what projects I have been working on, provide you with interesting information, and share little parts of myself with the world. I hope you enjoy!

            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/wfuEIYWxx88">Invention in the Style of Bach.</a>. I have always enjoyed counterpoint, but this was my first hack at working some out myself! I had spent the summer of 2021 studying from Gradus ad Parnassum, but this was my first time writing a proper piece in mostly invertable counterpoint without any kind of cantus firmus. I hope you enjoy this recording from my most recent recital!</li>
