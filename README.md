This is the repository for my personal website. I like simple and effective tools and designs, and
so I have sought the simplest technologies I can possibly manage to design and build my personal
website.

## Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

- [ ] Add C projects to secondary repositories so that they can stand out more.
