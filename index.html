                    Hello, and thank you for coming to my website. I am a pianist, organist, and composer who lives in Grand
                    Junction Colorado. I play in Swing City Express, the Western Colorado Jazz Orchestra, the Clark Gault
                    Dectet, and many other bands. I also play for various church and school organizations, including D51,
                    First United Methodist, and First Congregational United Church of Christ. Feel free to click around, and
                    see what I have going on!

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/wfuEIYWxx88">Invention in the Style of Bach.</a>. I have always enjoyed
                    counterpoint, but this was my first hack at working some out myself! I had spent the summer of 2021 studying
                    from Gradus ad Parnassum, but this was my first time writing a proper piece in mostly invertable
                    counterpoint without any kind of cantus firmus. I hope you enjoy this recording from my most recent recital!

                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiiVs74AaFU&t=101s">Maurice Ravel, Jeux d'eux</a>. I love this
                    piece of music, and I think this is a good example of where I am right now in my piano playing. I still have
                    a lot to work on, but I feel that I have made some very good progress.</li>
