            <h2>Jun 30, 2024</h2>
            <p> I think that, what I want to do with this blog is to write one fairly involved
            article every six months. I think that I have the material in my journal and notes for a
            few good drafts, so I think I should be able to get 5 or six articles up by the end of
            the summer. But, for now, I am focused on making this website into a good professional
            asset I can send to people for booking gigs and lessons. I would also love to get to the
            point where I can put it on a card and not be handing out my email and phone number to
            randoms all of the time!

            <h2>Jun 29, 2024</h2>
            <p>It is a little past midnight on June 29, 2024. It has been a ridiculous week. Most
            significantly, I have been selected to play Mozart in the upcoming production of Amadeus
            at the new theater. A few months ago, I auditioned on a whim. I thought it would be cool
            to learn a monologue and practice some acting chops, and I figured it would be a fun
            hobby. After my audition, Mo made it clear that I was not in the running. A month later,
            I have the part. Bafflingly. But now I have it, so I must do it well! I will now be
            studying "Active Analysis," by the wonderful soviet director Maria Knebel. God help me
            now...</p>

            <h2>June 28, 2022</h2>
            <p>Greetings world! This is my first blog entry. I am mostly just putting this up
            because I want to figure out how to have an internal link in one folder on my website,
            but I think it’s also a very good time to mention how exhausted I am by this whole
            thing. I feel like my whole life is just solving a whole bunch of tiny puzzles. And yet,
            I feel that there is an end goal in mind. I am beginning to see where I am going with
            all of this, and it is truly wonderful to think about! I think that I am going to have
            some truly wonderful skills by the end of all of this, and I am very excited to show the
            world. I think that’s all for today, so adieu! </p>
